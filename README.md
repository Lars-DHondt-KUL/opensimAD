# OpenSimAD
Windows libraries for OpenSimAD - OpenSim with support for Algorithmic Differentiation.

## How to generate an external function for use with CasADi?
OpenSimAD is used to formulate trajectory optimization problems with OpenSim musculoskeletal models. To leverage the benefits of algorithmic differentiation, we use [CasADi external functions](https://web.casadi.org/docs/#casadi-s-external-function). In our case, the external functions typically take as inputs the multi-body model states (joint positions and speeds) and controls (joint accelerations) and return the joint torques after solving inverse dynamics. The external functions can then be called when formulating trajectory optimization problems (e.g. https://github.com/KULeuvenNeuromechanics/PredSim, https://github.com/antoinefalisse/3dpredictsim and https://github.com/antoinefalisse/predictsim_mtp).


## Getting started
Here we provide code and examples to generate external functions automatically given an OpenSim musculoskeletal model (.osim file).
This workflow is not limited to full body models. [Any OpenSim model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71920801/143950905-9ef6263e-c763-409a-bf7e-905efd8d28b8.png) within the given [limitations](#Limitations) can be used to generate an external function.

### Install requirements (Windows)
  - Third-party software:
    - CMake (make sure cmake.exe is in your path)
    - Visual studio (tested with Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, 2022 Community editions)
    - MATLAB
    - CasADi

### Example
  - Make sure CasADi is in your MATLAB path. Use `addpath(genpath(casadi_path))` with casadi_path the path to the top folder of your CasADi download.
  - Run `main_opensimAD.m`
  - You should get as output a few files in the example folder. Among them: `F_test.cpp` and `F_test.dll`. The .cpp file contains the source code of the external function, whereas the .dll file is the [dynamically linked library](https://web.casadi.org/docs/#casadi-s-external-function) that can be called when formulating your trajectory optimization problem. `F_test_IO.mat` contains a struct `IO` with the indices relating to the different inputs and outputs of `F`.

### Limitations
  - Not all OpenSim models are supported:
    - Your model **should not have locked joints**. Please replace them with weld joints (locked joints would technically require having kinematic constraints, which is possible but makes the problem more complicated).
    - **Constraints will be ignored** (eg, coupling constraints).
    - **SimmSplines are not supported for coordinates**, as their implementation in OpenSim is not really compatible with algorithmic differentiation. See how we replaced the splines of the [LaiArnold_modifed model](https://simtk.org/projects/model-high-flex) with polynomials. SimmSplines in PathPoints etc. are fine, since they do not affect the inverse dynamics.
  - OpenSimAD does not support all features of OpenSim. **Make sure you verify what you are doing**. We have only used OpenSimAD for specific applications.

### Troubleshooting
- The code generates and runs .exe files, which can cause troubles with security policies. On KU Leuven GBW computers, run opensimAD from the C:/GBW_MyPrograms folder to prevent issues with group policy.
- When getting an error message containing "opensim" or "simbody", check your [OpenSim installation](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Scripting+with+Matlab) and path settings are correct.

## Compiling GenF
The included custom OpenSim libraries generate the expression graph as `foo.py`, which cannot be used with CasADi from MATLAB. To avoid the need to set up python, we have compiled the function that uses foo.py (`GenF.py`) into an executable that can be called from MATLAB (`./utilities/GenF/GenF.exe`).

To compile this yourself:
  - Open an Anaconda prompt
  - Create environment: `conda create -n opensimAD pip spyder python=3.8`
  - Activate environment: `conda activate opensimAD`
  - Navigate to the folder where you want to download the code: eg. `cd Documents`
  - Download code: `git clone https://github.com/Lars-DHondt-KUL/opensimAD.git`
  - Navigate to the folder: `cd opensimAD`
  - Install required packages: `python -m pip install casadi`
  - Install pyinstaller:  `conda install -c conda-forge pyinstaller`
  - Create an executable from GenF: `pyinstaller GenF.py  --distpath C:/.../opensimAD/utilities`

When running opensimAD, you can get an error from genF.exe that it cannot find casadi libraries. You then have to move the files from `./utilities/GenF/casadi/` to `./utilities/GenF/`.

## Source code
The libraries in `./opensimAD-install` were compiled from [here](https://github.com/antoinefalisse/opensim-core/tree/AD-recorder-work-py-install).
